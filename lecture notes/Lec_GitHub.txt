Steps for GitHub
git bash from the main folder (e.g WileyEdge is ur parent folder --> then gitbash from there)
1) Create the Repository with same name as your github repo name (Highly unlikely in work as you are not a lead developer yet)
2) Put all your files
3) Initialise git Repo using below command
 --> git init

4) Adding files into working tree
git add .

git add #Name of the File# (dun put it "git add" as it will add all the files)
git status (shows the files to be uploaded)

5) Commit your changes
git commit -m "first commit" 

6) Add main branch
git branch -M main (Used only once)

7) Connecting our local repo to github we add origin 
git remote add origin https://github.com/sathasivam95/Full-Stack-Development-Java.git

8) push the changes
git push -u origin main

Give credentials if it asks

Day to Day Work -->
1) git add
2) git commit
3) git push
