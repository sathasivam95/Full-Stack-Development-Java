w/o Static
Use the class to create the object.
Create an object and use dot notation to access.

w static
Shared among all classes.
If there is static, you do not need object to access it. (You don't need object to call static)
Use class name to access it, that's all.
Java allocates an integer/boolean/float/string with no value to 0/false/0.0/null.
this.x --> Points to the current object.

You cannot access non-static from static

If the condition is true, then program executes.
If the condition is not true, then program passes to else statement and executes it.

Package organises the program.
Scanner is a class that comes from java.util package.
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.println("Enter you age");
int age = sc.nextInt();
if (age<20)

Nested If-Else
If-else inside if-else

Interview Questions
What is the difference between while loop and do while loop.
Ans:
Can we have array of mixed variety in Java.
Ans: No, because Java is a static typed language.

For Loop

Array --> collection of similar items but all of similar types which are indexed
numbers.length --> Using length reduces the amount of human error
