Java --> java 8 
open source programming language, OOP (object oriented programming), compiled language, static typed language

java (english) 	--> compilation --> machine language (machine independency)

example.java 	--> compilation(java compiler) --> example.class (machine understands, windows, linux, mac understands class files)

1) Compilation 		-- java, typescript
2) Interpretation 	-- javascript, python (Python is pure object-oriented progamming)

python 	--> interpreted --> executes immediately

OOP 	--> style of programming where we consider everything as object

object 	--> real-world entity

object 	--> 1) properties/attributes/data e.g., (age, gender, color, passport)
	--> 2) functionality/behaviour e.g., (laptop runs games, run programs, plays videos and audio)

class 	--> template/blueprint for creating objects e.g., (clinic form, application form)

General Convention: start with capital words for class

Runtime Arguments --> Values that has to be accepted from the runtime

Static means you do need object to call. (No connection to object)

Access modifiers 	--> Public (Anyone can access)
			--> Private (Only you can access)
			--> Protected (Strangers cannot access, but your family members can)
