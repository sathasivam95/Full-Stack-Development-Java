MySQL Database

Data --> useful information

DBMS - Database Management System
Database -> organisation structure

RDMS - Relational Database Management System
We are organising our data in terms of table
Table -> rows and columns


E.g,.
College DBMS

Departments
id   dept_name   location
111  computer    Block-B
222  cvil        Block-C
333  mechanical  Block-D

Students
st_id  std_name  subject   dept    
101    Rajesh    Java      111
102    Tom       Motor     333
103    Harry     Java      111

Relational --> one table is related 
to another table using some common column, 
dept column n students table is mapped to id column in Departments table, 
we can not have dept record in students table which
does not exist in Departments table.

1	1  
0	1	
1	0	
0	1

Left Outer Join

1	NULL

Right Outer Join

NULL	1

cross join --> 25 rows
