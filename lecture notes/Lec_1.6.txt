Exercises

Write a class that implements the CharSequence interface found in the java.lang package.

Select one of the sentences from this book to use as the data.

int length(), 
char charAt(int index), 
CharSequence subsequence(int start, int end) 
and one function that reverses the string

2) Method is being used. 

3)



1a) Which method overrides a method in the superclass?
methodTwo

1b) Which method hides a method in the superclass?
methodFour

1c) What do the other methods do?
methodOne 
methodThree
cause errors
